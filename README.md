##Installation
###CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like NBSlideUpView in your projects.

```ruby
pod "NBEmojiSearchView"
```

###Alternative
Alternatively, you can just drag the <b>Source</b> folder into your project.
